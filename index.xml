      <description>scikit-tree# Scikit-tree is a package for modern tree-based algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning problems. It extends the robust API of scikit-learn &amp;lt;https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn&amp;gt;_ for tree algorithms that achieve strong performance in benchmark tasks.
Our package has implemented unsupervised forests (Geodesic Forests [Madhyastha2020]), oblique random forests (SPORF [Tomita2020] and MORF [Li2023]), and honest forests [Perry2021]. In the near future, we also plan to include extended isolation forests and stream decision forests [Xu2022]_.</description>

My theory by A. Elk. Brackets Miss, brackets. This theory goes as follows and begins now. All brontosauruses are thin at one end, much much thicker in the middle and then thin again at the far end. That is my theory, it is mine, and belongs to me and I own it, and what it is too.

      <description>This is quite important, for a website where the majority of the content is going to be prose.
Notice the font family being used for the prose, as well as the font family being used for the heading. Think about the spacing between the lines, as well as the spacing between various paragraphs. Also keep the font weight in mind, and consider if/how you want antialiasing and font-smoothing to work.</description>

      <description>The PyData Sphinx Theme uses sphinx-design to add several UI components and provide extra flexibility for content creation. These include badges, buttons, cards, and tabs, among other components. This theme provides custom CSS to ensure that sphinx-design elements look and feel consistent with this theme.
Seealso For more information about how to use these extensions, see the sphinx-design documentation. Below you can find some examples of the components created with the sphinx-design extension.</description>
